    Nature is all the animals, plants, and other things in the world that are not made by people, and all the events and
    processes that are not caused by people

    Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth. The field of geology
    encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials,
    and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is
    also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some
    Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.</p>
    <h2>Historical perspective</h2>
    
    Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other
    planets.[13] The Moon formed roughly 20 million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled,
    resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water
    vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.[14] The
    highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.
<h2>Atmosphere, climate, and weather</h2>
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.[27] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.
